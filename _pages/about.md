Welcome to my world wide web page of wizardly crafts.

I just graduated with an MSc in Communications & Signal Processing from Imperial, where my research thesis focused on representation
learning for multi-agent system optimization in the CSP lab. 

My passion lies at the intersection of computational science, Earth observation, and efficient digital agriculture.
I wish to hone my engineering skill-set to contribute in bridging the gap between software and hardware systems for 
enhancing environmentally conscious decision-making. Whether I am working to optimize satellite data to monitor emissions or forestation projects, or
building software for cheap sensors to analyze soil health in an agricultural field, I am driven by ensuring that new-age tech can assist us towards a greener earth.

I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in machine learning and software engineering roles with potential applications
in environmental monitoring, geospatial analysis, or autonomous robotic applications (cars, not defense).

War is over, if you want it.
