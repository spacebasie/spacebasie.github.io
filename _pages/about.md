Welcome to my world wide web page of wizardly crafts.

I just graduated with an MSc in Communications & Signal Processing from Imperial, where my research thesis focused on **representation learning for multi-agent system optimization** in the CSP lab.

## My Mission
My passion lies at the intersection of **computational science, Earth observation, and efficient digital agriculture**. I wish to hone my engineering skill-set to contribute in bridging the gap between software and hardware systems for enhancing environmentally conscious decision-making.

Whether I am working to:
* Optimize satellite data to monitor emissions or forestation projects
* Build software for cheap sensors to analyze soil health in an agricultural field

I am driven by ensuring that new-age tech can assist us towards a greener earth.

## Next Steps
I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in **machine learning, computer vision and data engineering roles** with potential applications in:
* Environmental monitoring
* Geospatial analysis
* Digital agriculture
* Autonomous robotics (cars, *not* defense)
