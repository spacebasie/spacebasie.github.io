## Communications & Signal Processing Lab (Imperial College London)
**MSc Researcher**
*London, UK | Dec. 2024 - Sep. 2025*

* Developed a novel communication protocol for self-supervised learning (SSL) in decentralized multi-agent networks that aligns latent representations to overcome challenges of non-IID data and domain shift.
* Demonstrated algorithmic robustness to data heterogeneity by achieving a 10% accuracy gain over centralized and federated baselines, validating convergence through analysis of 100+ experimental runs.
* Engineered a High-Performance Computing (HPC) simulation framework in PyTorch, optimizing resource allocation to benchmark distributed algorithms across complex network topologies and non-IID conditions.
