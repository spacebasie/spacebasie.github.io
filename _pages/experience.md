## Spartan Radar
**Software Engineering Intern**
*Los Alamitos, CA | May 2022 - May 2023*

* Engineered a Bayesian-based algorithm for dynamic object detection and classification, achieving an 8% improvement in accuracy through robust data engineering and validation.
* Built deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation of radar point cloud data, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction of complex road environments.
* Programmed advanced radar DSP algorithms in Python, enabling live data processing through the sensors, enhancing spectral resolution beyond standard FFT limits.
* Optimized core processing pipelines by implementing numerical linear algebra functions (SVD, Pseudoinverse) in C++, decreasing runtime by 15%.

## Subaru R&D
**Electrical Engineering Student Researcher**
*Ann Arbor, MI | Jan. 2022 - Dec. 2022*

* Led the development of an integrated ADAS data acquisition system.
* Implemented an eye-tracking CV algorithm to analyze driver attention for ADAS, informing the design of driver-centered interfaces.
* Conducted first-principles failure analysis (FMEA) to identify and mitigate critical product risks, improving system reliability.
* Developed an embedded button with synchronized, noise-reduced audio recording to capture driver behavior.

## Spartan Radar
**Systems Engineering & Integration Intern**
*Los Alamitos, CA | Jun. 2021 - Aug. 2021*

* Designed and executed comprehensive unit and integration test plans for indoor/outdoor mmWave radar calibration, analyzing data to evaluate testing accuracy and validate system performance.
* Created a Python GUI to assist with testing design calculations, reducing setup time by 30%.
* Analyzed data in Matlab for INS-GPS, evaluating testing accuracy and mapping route history to analyze ground-truth validity.
