title: "Funding Design and Innovation for Sustainable Development in Africa: A Review of Sources"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ODE_paper_2020
excerpt: 'Funding for design impacts the practical ability to address relevant problems. Using public sources, we explore funding aimed at design and business innovations for sustainable development in Africa provided by NGOs, governments, and multinational organizations. We focus on agriculture, energy, sanitation, and urban development, with successful or promising project examples. We conclude that country location, population or economic size do not drive government R&D spending; agricultural R&D funding is below targets; and NGOs combine funding with education and skill-building opportunities.'
