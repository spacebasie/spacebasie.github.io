**Jan. 2023 – Apr. 2023**

* Designed an autonomous maze-solving robot with a solution success rate of over 90%.
* Engineered a computer vision algorithm for real-time lane boundary identification from a video feed and optimized a motor controls system with robust adaptive cruise control capability at speeds up to 15cm/s.
* Developed an image-processing algorithm which identified stopping patterns and debugged edge cases to reduce false stops to none.
