**Jan. 2024 – Feb. 2024**

* Developed a Python-based spatial optimization algorithm to maximize sensor coverage of 1,000 fire surveillance towers on Aegean islets.
* Processed raw satellite imagery from USGS into a binary land/sea matrix map.
* Created visualizations of tower placement and land/sea coverage, and generated a data-frame with the precise coordinates and range recommendations for each tower.
